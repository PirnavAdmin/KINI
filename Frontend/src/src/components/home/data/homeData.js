Leadership requires 3+ years of industry experience. Book a free consultation — our counsellors will assess your level and recommend the right starting point.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are classes live or recorded?",
    a: "All sessions are 100% live. Every session is recorded and uploaded to your dashboard within 6 hours. You get lifetime access to recordings even after the program ends. No one falls behind because of a missed class.",
