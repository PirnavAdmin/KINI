  {
    q: "Do I need prior coding experience to join?",
    a: "It depends on the track. Full Stack, .NET, and AI programs need basic coding familiarity (200+ lines in any language). Data Science accepts strong Excel/SQL analysts. Leadership requires 3+ years of industry experience. Book a free consultation — our counsellors will assess your level and recommend the right starting point.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are classes live or recorded?",
    a: "All sessions are 100% live. Every session is recorded and uploaded to your dashboard within 6 hours. You get lifetime access to recordings even after the program ends. No one falls behind because of a missed class.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does placement support include?",
    a: "ATS-optimised resume review and rewrite, LinkedIn profile optimisation, GitHub portfolio curation, unlimited 1:1 mock interviews, warm referrals through our 200+ company alumni network, salary negotiation coaching, and continued support until you receive and accept an offer letter.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the refund policy?",
    a: "7-day full refund if you have attended fewer than 3 live sessions. After 7 days, pro-rated refund based on sessions attended. We also offer program pause or track transfer at no extra fee for genuine emergencies.",
  },
  {
    q: "How large are the cohorts?",
    a: "Each live cohort is capped at 30 students. Mentor-to-student ratio is 1:15. We keep cohorts deliberately small because we compete on outcome quality, not enrolment volume.",
  },
  {
    q: "What projects will I build?",
    a: "Each program includes 3 production-grade projects deployed on AWS or Azure with live URLs. Examples include an enterprise HR system (.NET), a RAG-powered AI chatbot (AI track), and a full-stack e-commerce platform (Full Stack).",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the typical salary outcome?",
    a: "Average first salary post-placement: ₹14 LPA. Freshers typically land ₹7–10 LPA. Career switchers: ₹8–12 LPA. Experienced developers upgrading stacks: ₹12–22 LPA. AI/GenAI track graduates: ₹18–40 LPA.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can I join after consultation?",
    a: "Most students join a live cohort within 7–14 days of their first consultation. Our counsellor calls within 24 hours of your form submission, walks through your options, and sends program details with batch schedule.",
